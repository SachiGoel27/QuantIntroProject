A Sharpe ratio compares an investment's return with its risk, since AAPL had a high ratio that means it has a higher excess return as compared to the risk an investor has to take, as compared to the other stocks. AAPL has a more attractive risk-adjusted return.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Yes it makes sense. For AAPL it had the highest risk of .2780 annualized volatility and devliered the highest return .1776. Similar with JNJ it had the lowest risk of .1619 and the lowest return of .0406. Since riskier assests provide more opportunity for higher returns, these values make sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. SPY is signifcantly less risky than AAPL, which is expected since SPY is an ETF while AAPL is one stock. However, it appears that SPY is slightly more risky than JNJ (determined by the annualized volatility), but this can also be explained since JNJ is a blue-chip stock with stable earnings."
